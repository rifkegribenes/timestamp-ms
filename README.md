## Timestamp microservice (Freecodecamp Project)

### User stories:

* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

#### Example Usage:

<https://vp-timestamp.herokuapp.com/December15,2015>

<https://vp-timestamp.herokuapp.com/1450137600>

#### Example Output:

```javascript
	{
	unix: 1450117800,
	natural: "December 15, 2015"
	}
	
```
